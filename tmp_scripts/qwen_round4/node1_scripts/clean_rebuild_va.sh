# Clean rebuild of vllm-ascend INCLUDING the AscendC custom operators.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and when to use it instead of rebuild_va.sh
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# rebuild_va.sh removes build/ dist/ *.egg-info. That is enough for the Python
# extension but NOT for the custom ops: the AscendC op packages are built under
# csrc/build and csrc/build_out, which rebuild_va.sh leaves in place, and the
# kernel compile step is stamped done after its first successful run.
#
# A kernel that lives entirely in a header -- e.g.
# csrc/moe/scatter_nd_update_v2/op_kernel/*.h -- has no build target depending
# on it, so it is NEVER recompiled by an incremental build. The build prints
# success in seconds while reinstalling the previously compiled .o.
#
# Measured on 2026-10-06: six consecutive builds reported EXIT=0 while all six
# shipped a kernel binary compiled four days earlier, which made six different
# source variants produce byte-identical results. Hence the guard at the end.
#
# Use rebuild_va.sh for Python or host-side C++ changes.
# Use this one whenever an AscendC kernel changed.
